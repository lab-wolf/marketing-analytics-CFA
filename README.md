- data/celebrity_worship_synthetic.csv (synthetic data for demo)

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Running Cronbachâ€™s alpha and interpreting reliability
- Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
- Model comparison: one-factor vs three-factor structure
- Explaining fit indices (Chi2, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR)

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter:
```python
!pip install semopy factor-analyzer pingouin
